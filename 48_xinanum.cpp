/*Namespace: The using namespace std; directive is used to avoid prefixing standard library components with std::.
CountDigitOccurrences Function:
Converts the number to a string using to_string.
Initializes a count variable to store the number of occurrences of digit
洧논
x.
Iterates through each character in the string representation of number.
Compares each character with the digit
洧논
x (converted to its character form).
Increments the count if the character matches
洧논
x.
Returns the count of occurrences.
Main Function:
Prompts the user to enter a number and the digit
洧논
x they want to count.
Checks if
洧논
x is a valid digit (0-9).
Calls countDigitOccurrences to compute the number of times
洧논
x occurs in number.
Outputs the result.
Example Usage:
If the user enters 121212 for the number and 1 for
洧논
x, the program will output "Digit 1 occurs 3 times in the number 121212.".
If the user enters 12345 for the number and 9 for
洧논
x, the program will output "Digit 9 occurs 0 times in the number 12345.".
This program efficiently counts occurrences of a specific digit
洧논
x in a given number by converting it to a string and iterating through each character, ensuring accurate and straightforward counting.
